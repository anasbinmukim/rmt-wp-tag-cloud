Encourage your customers to leave 5-star reviews on Google, Facebook, Yellow Pages, and more. Starfish Reviews is the #1 review marketing plugin for WordPress!

== Description ==

= Reputation Management & Review Marketing for Everyone! =

_Starfish Reviews Lite_ by [Starfish WP Plugins](http://starfish.reviews) enables reputation management campaigns on your WordPress website. Encourage positive, 5-star ratings and reviews while capturing negative reviews for internal improvement.

Send the Starfish "funnel" URL to your customers, users, followers, audience, etc and ask for feedback. The Starfish Reviews "funnel" will ask users how they feel about your site. If they like it, they'll be sent to whatever URL you set in the settings. This should be a link to the reviews section of wherever you want to get 5-star reviews. It could be your Google My Business listing, Facebook Page, Yelp listing, TripAdvisor page, podcast on iTunes, a digital product on an online marketplace, or a book on Amazon. Get 5-star reviews at any of those locations and many more! Anywhere that takes online reviews.

If people are not so happy with your product, service, media, etc, they'll be asked to provide feedback directly to you. This helps offset people's natural tendancy to only post reviews when they're upset, or when they've totally misunderstood the purpose of the review. You'll still learn what you can do to improve, but it won't be published permanently for the whole world to see.

== Installation ==

1. Go to Plugins > Add New and search "Starfish Reviews". Click the "Install Now" button, then the "Activate" button on this plugin.

2. Go to Settings > Permalinks and just click the "Save Changes" button. No need to do anything else on this page.

3. Go to the new "Starfish Reviews" section in your WP Admin sidebar. You'll need to put in the "Review Destination" URL and save this settings page. This should be the reviews section of whatever destination you want them to leave a review. Eg. (https://www.facebook.com/pg/StarfishWP/reviews/).

4. Copy the "Review Page URL" and send it via text message or email to your service customers, product users, podcast listeners, business clients, etc, asking them to provide you some feedback. The happy ones will be encouraged to leave a 5-star review at the location you put in step #2. The unhappy ones will be asked to provide feedback on how you can improve, which will be emailed directly to you, or wherever you set in the "Email Settings" portion of the settings.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use this to encourage reviews on ______ website? =
Yes, you can send people to whatever URL you want. So as long as the destination is 1. a website that can be linked to, and 2. it's publicly linkable, you can send people there. Note: some sites may make it more difficult than others to actually leave a review, and most require an account (eg. a Google account for Google My Business, Amazon for product reviews, etc).

= Could you add _____ feature? =
Feel free to let us know on the support forum. We'll consider adding new features and functionality to this Lite version of the plugin. Take note that the Pro editions already have many more features and functionality and have many more already scheduled for upcoming releases.
